**Overview**

This project explores the National Medical Expenditure dataset to study healthcare spending trends and its relationship with economic growth (GDP).

**Objective**

To analyze and visualize how medical expenditure has changed over time and how it correlates with GDP and per-person healthcare costs.

**Dataset**

File: National_Medical_Expenditure.csv

**Key Columns:**

->Year
->National Medical Expenditure
->Growth Rate
->Expenditure Per Person
->GDP

**Steps Performed**

1)Data loading and preprocessing
2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3)Trend and correlation analysis
4)Visualization of expenditure and GDP relationships
5)Optional regression modeling for prediction

**Key Insights**

->National Medical Expenditure has increased steadily over time.
->There is a strong positive correlation between GDP and medical expenditure.
->Per-person expenditure has also risen, reflecting higher healthcare costs.
->Economic growth and policy changes directly impact healthcare spending.

**Conclusion**

Healthcare costs continue to rise alongside GDP, showing that economic prosperity and healthcare spending go hand in hand. Predictive analysis on this dataset can help in policy planning, budget allocation, and future forecasting of national medical costs.
