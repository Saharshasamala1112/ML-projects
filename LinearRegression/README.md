**Overview**

This project analyzes a Loan Data dataset to identify key factors influencing loan approvals and builds a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

**Objective**

To predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant-specific details such as income, education, credit history, and property area.

**Dataset**

File: Loan_Data.csv

**Features include:**

->Gender, Married, Dependents
->Education, Self Employed
->Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income
->Loan Amount, Loan Term, Credit History, Property Area
->Loan Status (Target variable)

**Steps Performed**

1)Data loading and cleaning
2)Handling missing values
3)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
4)Feature encoding for categorical variables
5)Applying Linear Regression model
6)Evaluating model performance using regression metrics

**Key Insights**

->Applicants with a good credit history have a much higher chance of loan approval.
->Income level and education influence approval outcomes.
->Credit history shows the strongest correlation with loan status.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how machine learning can support fair and data-driven loan approval decisions. It helps banks streamline processes and reduce financial risk by relying on data insights instead of purely manual judgment.
